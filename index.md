# Hello Juniors! 😷

# Why you have redirected me to this site?
* I have made a rest api to compile code online and get output, which i need you guys to test/use and give feedback if anything goes wrong(which i think might be the case).

# Hey, Why should I?
> Hmm because i am <u>senior</u> and i order you to do so.😅

Hey Hey,don't be mad at me. Just kidding. I have listed below some advantages of using api. BTW i know that's not how seniority works.

* You guys having currently BWP subject in which you must be learning how to make calls to api and get response. Mine responds with json so it **might be** useful to you.

* You can leverage api to make frontend for api i.e. Online Compiler like this: [Online Compiler](https://mahiragrawal.github.io/Yet-Another-Online-Complier/). Currently as you might have seen my frontend is ugly feel free to fork my repo, make it yours and build a good interface. Additionally you can make login system to that online compiler and a dashboard too. Also github provides free hosting for static pages. So you are good to go.

* By just visiting this page, you might learn the very idea of hosting static pages online for free on github and that would benefit some of you who might be interested to make blogs online. Apne andar ke writer ko writer ko jaga lo. (Google Search "How to host on github for free?")

# Talk is cheap, show me the ~~code~~ api documentation?

Here it is:
[Postman Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22382845/UzXNTcZf)


> ⚠️❗
> **Note i have disabled the stdin temporarily. Will enable it soon and inform you. So if your code has any input reading line that line might result into time limit exceeded**

> **Currently four languages are supported which are c,cpp,java,python**

> **If you found something wrong with api please dm me at my number** 

### Lastly i just want to say that ~~thanks for reading this long~~ love storiyaan is not that bad for the line. Let's see how many of you get this.
